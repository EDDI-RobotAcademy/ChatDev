 Based on the provided code, I would recommend specifying the following dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file:

```python
unittest
```

As mentioned earlier, since numpy is not directly used in the given codebase, it's not necessary to include it as a dependency. However, if you want to ensure that other packages like pandas are installed when you install this project, you can use the following `requirements.txt` file:

```python
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```

But based on the code provided, it's safe to assume that only unittest is required for the calculator app to run properly.

Therefore, my final answer is:
```bash
unittest
```
