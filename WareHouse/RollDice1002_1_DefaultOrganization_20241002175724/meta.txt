 It seems like there was an issue with my previous response. It appears to be a jumbled mix of code snippets and unrelated text.

To provide a proper answer, I'll break down your original question and provide a concise solution:

You want to implement a thread-safe queue using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()` and a `threading.Lock` object to synchronize access.

Here's the corrected implementation:
```python
import threading
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        with self.lock:
            self.data.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.data:
                raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
            return self.data.pop(0)

def process_queue(queue):
    while True:
        try:
            item = queue.dequeue()
            # Process the item
            print(f"Processing item: {item}")
        except IndexError:
            break

queue = Queue()
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    for _ in range(5):
        executor.submit(process_queue, queue)
```
This code creates a `Queue` class that uses a `threading.Lock` to synchronize access to the underlying data list. The `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` methods use the lock to ensure thread safety.

The `process_queue()` function is defined as before, but now it's executed concurrently using a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
