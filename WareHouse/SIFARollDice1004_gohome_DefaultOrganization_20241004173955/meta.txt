Modality:
i agree with you that the roll dice app would benefit from a dynamic and interactive interface however, i think it's also worth considering it as an application with a simplified gui, or even a dashbaord where users can input parameters and see the result in real-time but if we want to stick to the original idea of ddd, then yes, an application modality would be suitable 

what do you think about exploring the possibility of it being a dashboard?
