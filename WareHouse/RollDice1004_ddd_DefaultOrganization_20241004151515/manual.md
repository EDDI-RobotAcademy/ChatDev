**Roll Dice App User Manual**

**Introduction**
===============

Welcome to the Roll Dice App! This application allows you to roll dice with a specified number of sides. The app uses Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to separate the concerns of the domain logic and the presentation layer.

**Main Functions**
================

The Roll Dice App has two main functions:

*   **Rolling the Dice**: You can roll the dice by clicking on the "Roll Dice" button. The number of sides for the dice is specified in the input field labeled "Number of Sides:". If you enter an invalid number or a number that exceeds the maximum value, an error message will be displayed.
*   **Quitting the App**: You can quit the app by clicking on the "Quit" button. A confirmation dialog will appear to ensure you want to quit.

**Installing Environment Dependencies**
=====================================

To run the Roll Dice App, you need to install the `tk` library using pip:

```bash
pip install tk>=8.6
```

**Using the App**
================

1.  Run the app by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
python main.py
    ```
2.  A window will appear with a label displaying "Roll Dice App".
3.  Enter the number of sides for the dice in the input field labeled "Number of Sides:".
4.  Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
5.  The current roll value will be displayed in the label above the input field.
6.  To quit the app, click on the "Quit" button and confirm your decision.

**Troubleshooting**
================

*   If you encounter any issues or errors while running the app, please check that the `tk` library is installed correctly.
*   If you are unable to roll the dice or display the current roll value, ensure that the input field contains a valid number of sides.
