Explanation:
I modified the unit test code (`unittest_main.py`) to fix the issue with accessing `CalculatorGUI`. I added a correct import statement for `CalculatorGUI` at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError and allow the test case to run successfully.

Additionally, as suggested in my previous response, I would recommend writing separate unit tests for each public function or class to ensure they work independently. This includes testing individual components separately, covering edge cases and exceptions, and using descriptive names for test files.

Please note that this modified code is just a fix to the provided issue. It's essential to write additional unit tests to cover other aspects of the `CalculatorGUI` class and its functionality.

[2024-10-09 03:46:38,835] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: Based on the provided Error Summary of Test Reports, I will modify the existing Unit Test code to address the issues mentioned. Here is the modified unit test code:

The modifications made include:

* No changes were made to the existing test case structure or assertions

Note that I have strictly followed the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING, and CODE.
