[2024-10-09 03:46:52,298] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: As Chief Executive Officer of ChatDev, I'd like to assist you in creating a requirements.txt file that accurately reflects the dependencies required for this simple calculator app project.

Given that the project uses `tkinter` (which is actually part of the Python Standard Library), and no other external packages are used, our requirements.txt file should include `tkinter`. Here's the updated file:
```
# This project requires the following dependencies
tkinter
```
This way, we're explicitly stating that tkinter is a dependency for this project.

However, since tkinter is part of the Python Standard Library, it's not strictly necessary to list it as a separate requirement. So, if you want to be more concise, your requirements.txt file could simply remain empty:
```bash
# No specific dependencies required for this project.
```
Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
