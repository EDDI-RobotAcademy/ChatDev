[2024-10-09 03:58:07,911] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: Based on the provided code files and the requirement of developing a simple calculator app in Python, I've identified the necessary dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. Here's the `requirements.txt` file:

```
tkinter
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
# Optional features
pint>=0.16
scipy>=1.6.2
# Test dependencies
unittest
```

These packages are required for the following reasons:
* `tkinter`: The Tkinter library is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the calculator app.
* `matplotlib`: This library is used to create interactive graphs based on calculations, which is an optional feature in the project requirements.
* `numpy` and `pandas`: These libraries are not explicitly required by the project but can be useful for advanced mathematical operations or data analysis. If these features are to be included, they will require numpy and pandas as dependencies.

Please note that you may need to adjust the versions of the packages based on your specific Python environment and requirements.
