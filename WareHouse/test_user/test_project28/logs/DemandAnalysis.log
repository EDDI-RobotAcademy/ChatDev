[2024-10-09 03:51:54,641] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: I propose we proceed with creating the detailed specification document outlining all the features and functionalities of the calculator app. We can use a tool like Google Docs or Microsoft PowerPoint to create and share the document.

The final product modality will be a standalone calculator application built using Python, with the following features:

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* History log to display previous calculations
* Clear button to remove the last calculation
* Reset button to clear all calculations and history
* Save button to save favorite calculations or create a list of frequently used calculations
* Edit button to edit previous calculations directly from the history log
* Interactive graphing feature to plot functions based on calculations
* Default functions for common mathematical operations like sine, cosine, and tangent
* Optional features:
	+ Convert button to convert calculations between different units
	+ Calculate button to perform advanced calculations

Let's proceed with creating the specification document!
