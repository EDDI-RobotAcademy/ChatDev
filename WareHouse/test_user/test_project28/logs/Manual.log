[2024-10-09 03:58:31,494] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: As the Chief Product Officer, I will write a detailed specification document outlining all the features and functionalities of the calculator app we can use a tool like Google Docs or Microsoft PowerPoint to create and share the document.

**Calculator App Specification Document**

**Introduction**

The Calculator App is a simple desktop application designed for basic mathematical calculations. The app will provide users with a user-friendly interface to perform arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Main Features**

1. **Mathematical Operations**
	* Addition (+)
	* Subtraction (-)
	* Multiplication (\*)
	* Division (/)
2. **History**
	* Store and display previous calculations
3. **Input Validation**
	* Validate user input for correct mathematical expressions
4. **Error Handling**
	* Handle errors when invalid or unsupported mathematical operations are performed

**User Interface**

1. **Text Input Field**
	* A text input field where users can enter mathematical expressions
2. **Calculation Button**
	* A button that triggers the calculation of the entered expression
3. **Result Display**
	* A label or text field that displays the result of the calculation
4. **History List**
	* A list or table that displays previous calculations and their results

**Optional Features**

1. **Unit Conversion**
	* Convert units of measurement (e.g., length, weight, time) for supported mathematical operations
2. **Polar Coordinates**
	* Perform trigonometric functions using polar coordinates

**System Requirements**

1. **Operating System**
	* Windows 10 or later
	* macOS High Sierra or later
	* Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or later)
2. **Processor**
	* Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent
3. **Memory**
	* 4 GB RAM or more

**Development Requirements**

1. **Programming Language**
	* Python 3.x
2. **Frameworks and Libraries**
	* Tkinter for GUI development
	* Matplotlib for graphing (optional)
3. **Unit Testing Framework**
	* Unittest for unit testing

**Deployment Requirements**

1. **Package Manager**
	* pip or conda for dependency management
2. **Operating System**
	* Windows 10 or later
	* macOS High Sierra or later
	* Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or later)

I will save this document as a Markdown file named `manual.md` in the root directory of our project.
