Modality:
i propose we proceed with creating the detailed specification document outlining all the features and functionalities of the calculator app we can use a tool like google docs or microsoft powerpoint to create and share the document

the final product modality will be a standalone calculator application built using python, with the following features:

* basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* history log to display previous calculations
* clear button to remove the last calculation
* reset button to clear all calculations and history
* save button to save favorite calculations or create a list of frequently used calculations
* edit button to edit previous calculations directly from the history log
* interactive graphing feature to plot functions based on calculations
* default functions for common mathematical operations like sine, cosine, and tangent
* optional features:
	+ convert button to convert calculations between different units
	+ calculate button to perform advanced calculations

let's proceed with creating the specification document!
