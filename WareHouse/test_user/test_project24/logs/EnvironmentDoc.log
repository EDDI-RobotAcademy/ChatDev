```
# No external dependencies required
```

However, I can propose an updated version of the `requirements.txt` file based on industry best practices and common Python projects. Here it is:

```python
# Minimal dependencies for a Python project

# No external dependencies required
# However, we can always add some common libraries if needed
```

But let's be honest, since you specifically asked me to provide a `requirements.txt` file, I'll create an empty one with a comment to indicate that no additional packages are being used:

```python
# Empty requirements.txt file for this project
```

If you're looking to add specific dependencies or external libraries, please let me know and I can update the `requirements.txt` accordingly.
