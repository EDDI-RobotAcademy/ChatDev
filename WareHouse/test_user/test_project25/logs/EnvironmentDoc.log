[2024-10-09 03:32:26,770] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: Based on your analysis, I would like to correct that `asteval` is indeed a custom implementation of safer evaluation using AST, but it's not part of the standard Python library. However, since it's used in this project, we should specify its version in the requirements.txt file.

Also, as you mentioned, `tkinter` is a built-in Python GUI library, so there's no need to specify it in the requirements.txt file.

So, here's the minimal `requirements.txt` file:
```
asteval==0.7.3
```
Let me know if this is correct!
