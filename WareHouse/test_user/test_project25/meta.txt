Modality:
i think we've got a solid plan in place for delivering a high-quality simple calculator app in python

let's proceed with scheduling the meeting with our development team to discuss the next steps i'll assign specific tasks to each member of the team:

* you can focus on implementing user input and output features
* another team member can take lead on designing a visually appealing interface using graphics and sound design
* our qa specialist will ensure that all features are thoroughly tested before moving forward with further development

using an agile methodology, we'll break down the project into smaller sprints with clear goals and objectives for each sprint this will allow us to make steady progress towards delivering a high-quality simple calculator app

let's discuss the meeting invite details: shall we schedule it for [insert date and time] in the conference room? i'll send out calendar invites to everyone involved, including our design team, to ensure they're aware of the discussion on incorporating graphics and sound design into our simple calculator app

powerpoint presentation will be used for this meeting
