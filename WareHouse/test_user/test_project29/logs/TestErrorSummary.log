[2024-10-09 20:54:50,618] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: Based on your provided source codes and test reports, I've identified a bug that causes the issue.

**Bug Summary:**

The bug is an `ImportError` caused by trying to import the `tk` module from the `button_handler` module. However, it seems like you're not using any GUI-related functionality in the `main.py` file.

**Root Cause:**

In the `main.py` file, you have the following line:
```python
from button_handler import ButtonHandler, tk
```
This is causing the error because there's no import of the `tk` module in the `button_handler` module. This suggests that you accidentally imported `tk` along with `ButtonHandler`.

**Solution:**

To fix this bug, simply remove the import of `tk` from the `main.py` file:
```python
from button_handler import ButtonHandler
```
This should resolve the issue, and your calculator program should run without any errors.
