[2024-10-09 03:40:15,175] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: Based on the provided source codes and test reports, I have identified a bug in your code.

**Bug Summary:**

The issue lies in the `main.py` file where you're trying to create an instance of the `GUI` class. The error message indicates that the name 'GUI' is not defined. This is because the `GUI` class is actually imported from the `gui.py` module, but it's being referenced without proper import.

**Detailed Explanation:**

In your `main.py` file, you have the following line:
```python
gui = GUI()
```
However, there's no explicit import statement for the `GUI` class. It seems that you're assuming it will be picked up from a local scope or previous imports in the file. This assumption is incorrect.

To fix this issue, simply add an import statement at the top of your `main.py` file to bring in the `GUI` class:
```python
from gui import GUI
```
This should resolve the `NameError: name 'GUI' is not defined` error and allow your code to run correctly.

**Additional Recommendations:**

While we've addressed the immediate bug, it's also a good idea to review your imports and ensure that you're following best practices for Python module management. Consider using relative or absolute import statements (e.g., `from .gui import GUI`) to make your code more readable and maintainable.

Please let me know if this solution resolves the issue for you!
[2024-10-09 03:40:45,850] - [phase.py file line:196] - INFO: After reviewing the source codes and test reports, I've identified the following bugs:

**Bug 1:** `NameError` when importing the `GUI` class in `main.py`

* The error message indicates that the `GUI` name is not defined.
* However, upon checking the code, it seems like the `GUI` class is indeed defined in the `gui.py` file.
* The issue might be due to the fact that the `GUI` class is not imported correctly. 

**Bug 2:** Missing import statement for `ButtonHandler` in `main.py`

* Although the `ButtonHandler` class is defined, it's not being imported correctly in the `main.py` file.
* This could cause a `NameError` when trying to access the `ButtonHandler` class.

**Bug 3:** UnboundLocalError in `calculate_expression()` function

* The error message suggests that an unbound local variable might be causing the issue.
* However, without further context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact problem.

To summarize, I've identified two potential bugs:

1. **Importing GUI class incorrectly**: Make sure the `GUI` class is imported correctly from the `gui.py` file in the `main.py` file.
2. **Missing import statement for ButtonHandler**: Ensure that the `ButtonHandler` class is being imported correctly in the `main.py` file.

Please verify and let me know if you need further assistance!
