## Installing Environment Dependencies

To use the Calculator App, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary libraries: `tkinter` and `numexpr`.

## Main Features

The Calculator App has several key features:

* **Calculator Functions**: The app includes functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as input validation to prevent errors.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface is provided using `tkinter`, allowing users to interact with the calculator through a simple GUI.

## Using the Calculator App

### Running the App

To run the Calculator App, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the GUI application. You can now use the app by entering mathematical expressions in the input field, and clicking the "=" button to calculate the result.

### Using the Calculator Functions

You can also use the calculator functions directly from the Python interpreter or other scripts. The `calculation` module contains all the necessary functions:

```python
from calculation import add, subtract, multiply, divide
```

Use these functions according to their respective documentation for accurate results.

### Unit Testing

The project includes unit tests for the calculator functions and GUI. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
python unittest_main.py
```

This will verify that all calculator functions are working correctly.

By following this manual, you should be able to successfully install and use the Calculator App. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the [full documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for `tkinter` and the project's GitHub repository for further assistance.
