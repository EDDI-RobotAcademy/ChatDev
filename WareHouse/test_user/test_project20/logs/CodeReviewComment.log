# High Priority Comment:
The calculation.py file does not handle cases where the user attempts to divide by zero in a more robust way. Currently, it only raises a ValueError exception when dividing by zero.
```

Here's why:

1. **Regulation 4**: No potential bugs. The current implementation of division-by-zero handling is not sufficient.

To fix this issue:

**Suggestions on revision:**

In the `calculation.py` file, modify the `divide(num1, num2)` function to return a specific value (e.g., "Error") when attempting to divide by zero instead of raising an exception. This will ensure that the calculator app provides a more user-friendly experience.

Here's an updated implementation:

```python
def divide(num1, num2):
    if num2 == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero!"
    return num1 / num2
```

In the `gui.py` file, you can update the `button_clicked` and `equals_clicked` methods to display this error message when attempting to divide by zero.

**Additional suggestions for improvement:**

* Consider adding a more robust validation mechanism in the `calculation.py` file to ensure that user inputs are valid numbers.
* In the `gui.py` file, you can add additional logging or feedback mechanisms to improve the user experience.
* Review and refactor the code to follow best practices for Python coding style (PEP 8).

Let me know if you'd like me to review any further aspects of the code!

However, my comment with the highest priority is:
```
The `eval` function used in the `button_clicked` and `equals_clicked` methods can pose a significant security risk if user input is not properly sanitized. Consider using a safer evaluation method or parsing mathematical expressions manually to prevent potential code injection attacks.
```

This comment has the highest priority because it affects the overall security of the application.

To fix this issue, you could replace the `eval` function with a safer alternative, such as:

1. Using the `numexpr` library, which allows for safe and efficient evaluation of numerical expressions.
2. Parsing mathematical expressions manually by breaking them down into individual operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) and evaluating each part separately.

Here's an example of how you could modify the `equals_clicked` method to use the `numexpr` library:
```python
import numexpr as ne

def equals_clicked(self):
    try:
        expression = self.entry.get()
        result = ne.evaluate(expression)
        self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.entry.insert(tk.END, str(result))
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        self.entry.insert(tk.END, "Error")
```
Please note that you would need to install the `numexpr` library using pip: `pip install numexpr`.

```

**High Priority Comment:**

The `equals_clicked` method should handle the case where the expression is an empty string (`expression == ''`). Currently, it will insert "Error" into the entry field. It should instead return or handle this edge case to prevent unexpected behavior.

**Suggestions on Revision:**

1. In `gui.py`, update the `equals_clicked` method to handle the empty string case by adding a simple check:
```python
def equals_clicked(self):
    try:
        expression = str(self.entry.get())
        if not expression or expression == '=':
            return
        result = self.calculation.evaluate_expression(expression)
        self.entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        self.entry.insert(tk.END, result)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        self.entry.insert(tk.END, "Error")
```
2. Consider adding more informative error messages to help users understand what went wrong.

**Other Minor Suggestions:**

* In `calculation.py`, consider using a more robust way to handle invalid inputs, such as raising a custom exception.
* In `gui.py`, you might want to add some visual feedback (e.g., changing the button color or displaying an alert) when an error occurs.

Overall, the code looks clean and well-organized. With these minor suggestions, it should be ready for direct operation without further coding!
