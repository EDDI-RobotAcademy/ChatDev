# Roll Dice App
=====================

## Introduction

Welcome to the Roll Dice App! This is a simple Python application that allows users to roll virtual dice and view their results.

### Main Functions

*   **Roll Dice**: Users can enter the number of dice they want to roll, and the app will generate random outcomes.
*   **View Results**: The app displays the results of each die rolled in a comma-separated list.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
pip install random
```

This will install the required `random` library.

## Running the App

To run the app, navigate to the directory where you saved the files using your terminal or command prompt. Then, type:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the application, and you'll see a window with an input field and two buttons: "Roll Dice" and "Reset Roll Count".

### How to Use

1.  Enter the number of dice you want to roll in the input field.
2.  Click the "Roll Dice" button to generate random outcomes for each die.
3.  The app will display the results of each die rolled in a comma-separated list below the input field.
4.  To reset the roll count and start fresh, click the "Reset Roll Count" button.

## Requirements

*   Python installed on your machine
*   `random` library (install using `pip install random`)

## Dependencies

*   The `random` library is required for generating random outcomes.
