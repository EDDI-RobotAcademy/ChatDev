Modality:
i agree that the application modality is a great fit for this task the interactive nature of the dice rolling game would be better suited for an application rather than a presentation or document

the customer's requirement to simulate a dice rolling game implies a need for user input, processing, and output, which are all characteristics of an application additionally, using domain driven design (ddd) as mentioned in the task, suggests a complex domain logic that would be better handled within an application

i also think that using python as the programming language is a good choice for this application modality
