# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

To get started with LangChain, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install langchain` or `conda install langchain -c conda-forge`.
2. Set up your environment by creating a new Python file and importing the necessary modules.
3. Start building your applications using LangChain's API.

## Main Functions of LangChain

LangChain provides several key features to help you build powerful applications:

* **Question Answering:** Use LLMs to answer questions over specific documents or databases.
* **Agents:** Combine GPT with other knowledge sources like WolframAlpha for more comprehensive answers.
* **Composability:** Easily combine multiple LLMs and knowledge sources to create complex applications.

## Using LangChain

To use LangChain, follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance of the `DiceRollerGUI` class to set up your GUI.
2. Click the roll button to generate a random number between 1 and 6 (or your custom range).
3. Use the `roll_dice()` method to get the result of rolling the dice.

## Customizing LangChain

You can customize LangChain by:

* Changing the number of sides on the dice using the `dice.sides` attribute.
* Creating a new instance of the `DiceRollerGUI` class with your custom settings.

## Advanced Topics

For more advanced users, LangChain provides additional features and integrations, including:

* **Agent Integration:** Combine GPT with other knowledge sources like WolframAlpha for more comprehensive answers.
* **Composability API:** Easily combine multiple LLMs and knowledge sources to create complex applications.
* **Helper Functions:** Access a range of helper functions for tasks like data processing and visualization.
