Modality:
i agree that application is a great option for a roll dice app the interactivity and visual feedback it would provide could be really engaging however, considering the simplicity of rolling dice, i think a dashboard modality might also be suitable it's a more straightforward way to display the result without requiring any complex interactions

your turn!
