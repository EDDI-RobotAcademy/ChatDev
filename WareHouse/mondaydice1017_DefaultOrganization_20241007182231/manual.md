# Dice Rolling Game
=====================

## Introduction
---------------

Welcome to the Dice Rolling Game! This application simulates a game where you can roll a dice and check its face value. The game utilizes Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for a more robust and maintainable design.

## Main Functions
------------------

### 1. Roll the Dice

The main function of this game is to roll the dice, which generates a random face value between 1 and 6.

### 2. Check Face Value

You can check the current face value of the rolled dice at any time.

### 3. Unit Testing

The application comes with unit tests for edge cases of the Dice class's methods.
