Let's discuss this new customer's request. Considering we have already developed various products in different modalities, I think an Application would be a great fit for the roll dice game. It can utilize Python as its programming language and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to create a robust and maintainable application.

What are your thoughts on using an Application modality for this project?
