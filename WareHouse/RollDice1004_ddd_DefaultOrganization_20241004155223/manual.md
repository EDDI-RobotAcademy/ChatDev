# Dice Roller User Manual
------------------------

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dice Roller! This is a simple Python application that simulates rolling dice. It's designed to be easy to use and understand.

## Features

* Simulate rolling one or more dice with any number of sides (default is 6)
* Generate random outcomes for each die
* Allow users to specify the number of sides on each die
* Provide a way to test the application with invalid input types

## Installation

To install the Dice Roller, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install dice_roller
```

## Usage

1. Import the `DiceRoller` class from the `dice_roller` module:
    ```python
from dice_roller import DiceRoller
```
2. Create an instance of the `DiceRoller` class:
    ```python
roller = DiceRoller()
```
3. Call the `roll_dice()` method to simulate rolling one or more dice:
    ```python
outcome = roller.roll_dice(1, 6)  # roll 1 six-sided die
print(outcome)
```

## Testing

To test the application with invalid input types, use a try-except block and catch any exceptions that are raised. For example:

```python
try:
    outcome = roller.roll_dice("hello")  # pass a string as an argument
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # print the exception message
```

# GUI Controller User Manual
---------------------------

## Introduction

Welcome to the GUI Controller! This is a Python application that uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface. It's designed to be easy to use and understand.

## Features

* Create a window with a specified size
* Draw a GUI on the screen
* Handle events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input

## Installation

To install the GUI Controller, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

1. Import the `GUIController` class from the `gui_controller` module:
    ```python
from gui_controller import GUIController
```
2. Create an instance of the `GUIController` class:
    ```python
controller = GUIController()
```
3. Call the `drawGUI()` method to draw a GUI on the screen:
    ```python
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
try:
    controller.drawGUI(screen)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # print any exceptions that are raised
```

## Testing

To test the application with unexpected events, use a try-except block and catch any exceptions that are raised. For example:

```python
try:
    event = pygame.event.Event(pygame.QUIT)
    controller.handle_events(event)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # print the exception message
```

**manual_roll_dice_app.md**
==========================

# Roll Dice App User Manual
---------------------------

## Introduction

Welcome to the Roll Dice App! This is a Python application that uses the `RollDiceApp` class from the `roll_dice_app` module. It's designed to be easy to use and understand.

## Features

* Simulate rolling dice with any number of sides (default is 6)
* Generate random outcomes for each die
* Allow users to specify the number of sides on each die
* Provide a way to test the application with invalid input types and large inputs

## Installation

To install the Roll Dice App, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install roll_dice_app
```

## Usage

1. Import the `RollDiceApp` class from the `roll_dice_app` module:
    ```python
from roll_dice_app import RollDiceApp
```
2. Create an instance of the `RollDiceApp` class:
    ```python
app = RollDiceApp()
```
3. Call the `run_app()` method to simulate rolling one or more dice:
    ```python
outcome = app.run_app(5)  # roll 5 six-sided dice
print(outcome)
```

## Testing

To test the application with invalid input types and large inputs, use a try-except block and catch any exceptions that are raised. For example:

```python
try:
    app.run_app("hello")  # pass a string as an argument
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # print the exception message

try:
    app.run_app(1000)  # pass a large integer value
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # print the exception message
```
