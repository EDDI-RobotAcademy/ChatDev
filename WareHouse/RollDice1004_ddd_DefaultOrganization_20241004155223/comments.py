Comments on the existing code:
The `GUIController` class has been refactored to remove its dependency on the `DiceRoller` class.
Instead, it now accepts an instance of `DiceRoller` as a parameter in its constructor.
Suggestions for revision:
1. Consider adding more comments and documentation to the code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
2. Use a more consistent naming convention throughout the codebase (e.g., use camelCase for method names).
3. Consider using a testing framework to write unit tests for the code to ensure its correctness.
Overall, the code looks good, but there are some areas that need improvement to make it more robust and maintainable.
